Hi, Iâ€™m Shayne Pierce @Nextakeoff

I'm intereested in programming with C# and .NET.  I'm creating software that makes my life easier as a construction estimator.

Goals
- PDF Viewer and tracer of architectrual plans
- Estimating program (Various versions aleady done and being using for around 15-20 years)
- Enjoy the troubleshooting, and creating a better work flow to save myself an end users time.
